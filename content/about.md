### Why write this blog ?
I've come to a point where I'm confident enough in my capabilities as a developer to start writing about some projects I'm working on. The objective of this is to have a history of what I've worked on, a kind of personal documentation (because we always remember everything, right ?).

Hopefully you'll enjoy the content I'll be putting out, and maybe someone might learn a thing or two !

If you end up spotting what you believe is a mistake, please feel free to contact me, I'm always looking for opportunities to improve.

### What kind of content can you expect to find here ?
__Absolutely anything tech related !__ 
I want this to be some kind of knowledge centre. I'll be writing about the quirks of learning a new language, the struggles I've had setting up my own VPN or the silly bot ideas that happen to cross my mind.
