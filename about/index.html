<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been wanting to write about the projects I&rsquo;m working on in order to create some documentation I can refer to later on. I will therefore publish brief articles about anything related to technology, computer science and programming.</p>

<h1 id="a-bit-about-myself">A bit about myself</h1>
<p>I first encountered programming when I was thirteen years old. My uncle bought me an Arduino kit filled with sensors, buttons, LEDs, … I vividly remember being so proud of my first circuits which consisted of triggering annoying beepers and blinking lights. Simple instructions on a computer screen making actual hardware to do “stuff” fascinated me and I knew then that programming would be part of my daily life.</p>
<p>My projects slowly grew in complexity, from a cane for the visually impared with wrist mounted ultrasonic sensors causing a smartphone to vibrate, to designing and assembling a robot capable of following a line, avoiding obstacles and collecting 3D printed balls.</p>
<p>Self-taught online through high school, my goal was always to enroll in an Engineering School to pursue a degree in computer science. Since becoming a student, I have acquired skills in web development, object oriented programming, systems administration, complex mathematics and more.</p>
<p>I have developed a real interest for the technologies of the web, creating websites, managing databases, deploying containers and virtual machines, configuring and maintaining VPNs, web servers and CI/CD pipelines.</p>
<p>I am familiar with HTML/CSS/JS, the Node.js platform (and the frameworks that live within it such as Vue.js, Angular, Express.js, …), PHP and SQL based database management systems. I have some experience automating the deployment of websites using GitLab runners on servers running Nginx. I have dabbled in AWS EC2 instances to host a WireGuard VPN, used C, Python, Pascal and Java extensively and followed introductory classes to 32 bit assembly, SWI-Prolog and R.</p>
